# {frontmatter.title}

Since I have a little more freedom, and no character limit, I thought it would be fitting for my first blog post to be a little more about myself.

Hi! I'm Jasper, a 27 year old self-taught web developer from Ghent.

## Career

I've been professionally coding since Mar 2018.

I'm currently employed at [Two Point O](https://www.two-point-o.be/) as a Frontend developer since Jan 2022.
Mainly working with technologies such as Gatsby, Stenciljs and Contentful. Before joining II.O, I worked at 2 differentent web design agencies working with PHP technologies like Drupal.

As of writing this, I haven't got the slightest clue where I want to end up in a few years time.
The plan for now is to continue growing as a developer, build cool projects both professionally and on the side and learn new tech. I really believe II.O is the best place I could be right now in my career and I don't think that will change any time soon.

## Hobbies

My hobbies include gaming, hiking and snowboarding.

Right now I'm playing a lot of Oldschool Runescape, it's still such a great game, but I tend to rotate a lot. Some other titles I enjoy playing: World of Warcraft, Valheim, Fortnite (zero build), Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch.

I try to schedule in some livestreams from time to time, so if you ever want to see some Oldschool Runescape action then you can follow me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwnudQSSsYMMbseZFwxV06Q) and get notified when I go live! I might stream programming too, so that's cool.
